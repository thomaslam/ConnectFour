Connect4 Program
==========
A computer simulation of Connect Four boardgame. Player can either play against another human player or computer AI. The algorithm for the computer AI is Minimax algorithm. My evaluation heuristics is basically counting all the possible combinations of "fours" given a specific location on the grid and putting these numbers in a 6x7 matrix (see variable evaluationTable in GameContentComponents class)
